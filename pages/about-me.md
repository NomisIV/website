## What about "NomisIV"?

It's my online nickname.
It was preceded by `grunkamoj900`, which I ultimately found too cringe to continue using.
So instead I came up with `NomisIV` when creating my PSN account for my PS3.
If you have a good eye for reversed words,
you will probably notice that it's basically just my first name reversed.
The "IV" at the end are just the first roman numerals that resulted in a name that wasn't already used on PSN.
And then it just kinda stuck.

## What about the profile picture?

It's my online avatar, or my digital "face".
I wrote it in SVG. Yeah, I know what I said, I wrote an image.
For those of you who don't care:
SVG is a text based image format where I can basically describe (although very tersely)
an image using keywords and numbers, which represent shapes and coordinates.
So I basically just sat and counted and calculated the positions of every corner in the image.
No I'm not insane, it's like sudokus or nanograms.
*It's soothing!*
