## Programming languages sorted from *based* to *cringe*:

Since I don't have experience with all of these languages,
they are sorted by how likely I am to chose a project written in the particular language,
and *not* how likely I am to chose it for my next project.

After each language is my rating as a developer (0 to 9, 9 being the best) of the language,
followed by a question mark if I haven't tried it yet.

1. [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) *8* - Will there ever be a better language
1. [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language) *6* - It's almost like latin at this point
1. [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) *7?* - If C is latin, is this French?
1. [Python](https://pyhton.org) *4* - I can't take python seriously
1. [Perl](https://perl.org) *5?* - Uuhh... It's cool I guess?
1. [Shell / Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) *3* - Only masochists write in shell
1. [Lua](https://lua.org) *4* - This is a *configuring* language
1. [Haskell](https://haskell.org) *7?* - I love how "mathematical" it is
1. [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) *5?* - It's got an interesting "object" model
1. [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) *5?* - Is it like JavaScript but also like Java?
1. [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) *2* - This is like sleeping on a bed of nails
1. [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) *2* - GOTO bed
1. [Zig](https://ziglang.org) *4?* - [This](https://github.com/ifreund/river) is the only project in zig
1. [Java](https://java.com) *3* - I'll give it one thing: it's got structure
1. [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language) *3?* - It's neat, but quite unpractical
1. [Go](https://golang.org) *4?* - I suspect google puts trackers in every binary
1. [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_programming_language) *4* - It's a language. That's about it.
1. [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) *4* - This is what JS should have been
1. [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org) *4?* - Uuhh... Can I have TeaScript instead?
1. [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) *3* - this === "a beautiful mess"
1. [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) *2?* - This doesn't make you cool, Microsoft
1. [PHP](https://php.net) *2?* - I'll find any excuse not to learn PHP
1. [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) *1?* - Is this what the neanderthals used?
1. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) *2* - is this even a language lol
