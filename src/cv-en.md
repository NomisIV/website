## Summary

Do you value efficiency, reliability and quality? So do I!
I'm an ambitious and computer-interested young man,
with an eye for perfecting the details.
I value open-source, and I use linux on all of my computers.
The programming languages I'm most proficient in are
Rust, Nix, Python, JavaScript / TypeScript and Java.
In my spare time I spend a lot of time working on personal coding projects,
like my own website.

Another interest of mine is biking,
because it gets me out into nature and it makes me feel alive.
I have four bikes, one of which I built myself from bike scraps I got from my dad.

Developing my own website has always been something I've wanted to do.
So I made one, completely from scratch.
